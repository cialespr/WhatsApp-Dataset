This folder contains the annotated WhatsApp chats in a stand-off XML format. The letter in the file name corresponds to a specific scenarios given to the students:

- A: Your shy male classmate has a great passion for classical dance. Usually he does not talk much, but today he has decided to invite the classroom to watch him for his ballet show. 
- B: Your classmate is very good at school, but does not have many friends, due to his haughty and `teacher's pet' attitude. Few days ago, he realised that his classmates brought cigarettes to school and snitched on them with the teacher. Now they will be met with a three days suspension, and they risk to fail the year.
- C: Your classmate is very good at school, and everyone think he is an overachiever. He studies a lot and he never goes out. He does not speak much with his classmates, that from time to time tease him for his unsocial life. Things have slightly changed recently: your classmateâ€™s mum convinced teachers to increase the homework for all the students. A heedless teacher revealed the request to the classroom, and now some students are very angry at him.
- D: Your shy classmate is good in all subjects but in physical education. For this reason, his classmates often tease on him when he exercises. Recently, the classroom has found out a video on the social network Musical.ly, where he dances gracelessly, on a 90s song that no one has never heard before.
